GetOpt
------

This library serves the purpose to parse options in a command line. It works
as getopt in POSIX and also supports the GNU extensions. Options starting with
"-" or "--" can occur at any argument position. "--" itself causes that all
subsequent arguments are treated as non-option arguments.

Each option can have a short form (single character) starting with "-" and/or
a long form (multiple characters) starting with "--".


Requirements
------------

This library compiles to .NET Standard 2.0 and can be used by all .NET
Framework and Core versions that support .NET Standard 2.0.
